The aim of Copenhagen University Datalab is to teach researchers, teachers and 
students basic concepts, skills and tools for working with data so that they
can get more done in less time, and with less pain.

This is an introduction to visualising data. Instead of working with code, we
take an abstract approach, and discuss the different tips tricks and pitfalls 
when we make visualisations of our data.

These pages are currently under heavy construction. The only webpages that are
